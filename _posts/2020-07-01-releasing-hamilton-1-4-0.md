Very exciting to announce that the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [Hamilton](https://github.com/ngzhio/jekyll-theme-hamilton) [1.4.0](https://github.com/ngzhio/jekyll-theme-hamilton/releases/tag/v1.4.0) has been released. This is a version iteration with a lot of changes, that mostly are UI related, but sometimes changes in interface layout and operation can greatly improve productivity.

The enhancements include:

1. **A sticky header**. When we scroll a long page, the header (the navigation) is always sticky on the top of the viewport, so that we don't have to scroll back to the top of the page for finding the navigation.
2. **A sticky sidebar**. Before 1.4.0, Hamilton is a one-column theme. Now the body has been split into two columns: left the sidebar, and right the main content of the page. I have moved the information of the author, the subscribe button, and the social media list from the footer into the sidebar, so that we don't have to scroll to the bottom to find this information. Besides, the sidebar still has vacancies for future functional expansion.

Let's see the Hamilton theme has become how beautiful.
