The GitHub Archive Program is a project for preserving open-source software for future generations. For that, they also list a selection of works (called the [Tech Tree](https://github.com/github/archive-program/blob/master/TheTechTree.md) by them) intended to describe how the world makes and uses software today. Now I want to learn that list.
