This to-do list was inspired by [Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_) and [Myles Byrne](https://twitter.com/quackingduck)'s guide [*Teach Yourself Computer Science*](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), but I made an expansion based on that list. I hope it is also helpful for you. Any advice is welcome; You can write it on the comments below this post, as long as you have a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) account, or you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/ngzhio/ngzhio.github.io/issues/new).
