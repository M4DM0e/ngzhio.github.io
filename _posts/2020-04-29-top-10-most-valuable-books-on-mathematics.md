I have compiled 10 most valuable books on mathematics here. Why do you say that they are "most valuable"? I developed a [website](https://ngzhio.github.io/dbl/) to sort the search results of [Douban Books](https://book.douban.com/) by [Bayesian average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_average) scores from largest to smallest. The rankings here are obtained by searching "mathematics" on the website and picking the top 10 books in the results. (Note: Different versions of the same book are considered a book.)

## Top 1. *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science*

[*Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) by [Ronald Graham](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/), [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/), and [Oren Patashnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oren_Patashnik) is a textbook that is widely used in computer-science departments as a substantive but light-hearted treatment of the analysis of algorithms.

## Top 2. *Course of Differential and Integral Calculus*

*Course of Differential and Integral Calculus* (*Курс дифференциального и интегрального исчисления*) by Grigory Mikhailovich Fikhtengolts ([Григо́рий Миха́йлович Фихтенго́льц](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D1%85%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86,_%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87)) has served and still serves as a textbook and handbook for a number of generations of mathematicians. Despite the availability of textbooks written in a more modern mathematical language, for example, the two-volume work of Richard Courant, the Fichtenholtz course is still very popular. The first edition of this textbook was published in 1947.

## Top 3. *Thomas' Calculus*

[*Thomas' Calculus*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134438981) by Joel R. Hass, Christopher E. Heil, and Maurice D. Weir is a textbook on calculus that is more suitable for undergraduate students of non-mathematics. It helps students reach the level of mathematical proficiency and maturity you require, but with support for students who need it through its balance of clear and intuitive explanations, current applications, and generalized concepts.

## Top 4. *Analysis* by Terence Tao (陶哲轩)

![front cover](https://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9789811017896.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Analysis*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811017896) by [Terence Tao](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/) is a book on real analysis and is intended for senior undergraduate students of mathematics who have already been exposed to calculus. The emphasis is on rigour and foundations of analysis. Beginning with the construction of the number systems and set theory, the book discusses the basics of analysis (limits, series, continuity, differentiation, Riemann integration), through to power series, several variable calculus and Fourier analysis, and then finally the Lebesgue integral.

## Top 5. *What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas And Methods*

![front cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ed/What_Is_Mathematics.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas And Methods*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Mathematics%3F) by [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant) and [Herbert Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Robbins) is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public.

First published in 1941, it discusses number theory, geometry, topology and calculus. A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)).

## Top 6. *Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/312V9A4mghL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521592712) by [E. T. Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) dispels the imaginary distinction between "probability theory" and "statistical inference", leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. It discusses new results, along with applications of probability theory to a variety of problems. The book contains many exercises and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. Aimed at readers already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher, it is of interest to scientists concerned with inference from incomplete information.

## Top 7. *Linear Algebra and Its Applications*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DwrFPH2uL._SX398_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Linear Algebra and Its Applications*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/032198238X) by [David C. Lay](https://www-math.umd.edu/about-us/math-news/715-in-memory-of-our-colleague-david-c-lay.html) is a popular textbook on linear algebra. This book makes abstract concepts in linear algebra more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete \\\(R^n\\\) setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand.

## Top 8. *Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41AF%2Bz8oXZL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JAK4LTQ) by [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein) was first published between 1902 and 1908. These volumes are lecture notes of courses that Klein offered to future mathematics teachers, realizing a new form of teacher training that remained valid and effective until today: Klein leads the students to gain a more comprehensive and methodological point of view on school mathematics. The volumes enable us to understand Klein’s far-reaching conception of elementarisation, of the “elementary from a higher standpoint”, in its implementation for school mathematics.

## Top 9. *The Princeton Companion to Mathematics*

![front cover](https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691118802.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*The Princeton Companion to Mathematics*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691118802/the-princeton-companion-to-mathematics) is a one-of-a-kind reference for anyone with a serious interest in mathematics. Edited by [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers), a recipient of the Fields Medal, it presents nearly two hundred entries, written especially for this book by some of the world’s leading mathematicians, that introduce basic mathematical tools and vocabulary; trace the development of modern mathematics; explain essential terms and concepts; examine core ideas in major areas of mathematics; describe the achievements of scores of famous mathematicians; explore the impact of mathematics on other disciplines such as biology, finance, and music —- and much, much more.

## Top 10. *Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41l-ja0iQ9L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_and_Plausible_Reasoning) is a two-volume book by the mathematician [George Pólya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya) describing various methods for being a good guesser of new mathematical results.
