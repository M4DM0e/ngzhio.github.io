[*Teach Yourself Computer Science*](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) written by [Oz Nova](https://twitter.com/oznova_) and [Myles Byrne](https://twitter.com/quackingduck) is a guide for self-taught engineers or boot camp grads to learn computer science. They listed subjects should be learned and introduced the best book or video for each subject. I plan to learn these resources and expand the list. If you have a better suggestion, welcome to tell me on the comments below this post, as long as you have a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) account, or you can open an Issue if you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

## Programming

> Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.

## Computer Architecture

> If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

> If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.

## Math for CS

> CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.

## Operating Systems

> Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.

## Computer Networking

> The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.
