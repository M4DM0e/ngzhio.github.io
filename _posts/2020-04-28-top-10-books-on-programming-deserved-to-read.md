Here are 10 books on programming that are deserved to read. This list is sorted out from a [website](https://ngzhio.github.io/dbl/) I created.

## Top 1. *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*

![front cover](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/images/csapp3e-cover.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) by [Randal E. Bryant](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant) and [David R. O'Hallaron](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~droh) is a book that stems from the introductory computer systems course the authors developed at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in the Fall of 1998, called "Introduction to Computer Systems" (ICS). The presentation is based on the following principles, which aim to help the students become better programmers and to help prepare them for upper-level systems courses:

- Students should be introduced to computer systems from the perspective of a programmer, rather from the more traditional perspective of a system implementer.
- Students should get a view of the complete system, comprising the hardware, operating system, compiler, and network.
- Students learn best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines.

This book covers data representations, machine level representations of C programs, processor architecture, program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent programming. These concepts are supported by series of fun and hands-on lab assignments.

## Top 2. *The C Programming Language*

[*The C Programming Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) by [Brian W. Kernighan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/) and [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today.

## Top 3. *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*

![front cover](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/cover.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp) by [Harold Abelson](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/hal.html) and [Gerald Jay Sussman](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/gjs.html) with Julie Sussman is a computer science textbook, that teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.

## Top 4. *Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51eiC9ZRVZL._SX396_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321334876) by [Scott Meyers](https://www.aristeia.com/) is not a book for beginners of C++. It's a highly recommended second book for learning C++. It teaches you how to write effective C++ code by throwing some rules, called items.

## Top 5. *UNIX Network Programming*

![front cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Rstevens_unp_1990.jpeg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*UNIX Network Programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_Network_Programming) by [W. Richard Stevens](http://www.kohala.com/start/) was first published in 1990. In later, this book was expanded into two volumes to publish. The book focuses on the design and development of network software under UNIX. The book provides descriptions of how and why a given solution works and includes 15000 lines of C code. The book's summary describes it as "for programmers seeking an in depth tutorial on sockets, transport level interface (TLI), interprocess communications (IPC) facilities under System V and BSD UNIX."

## Top 6. *Introduction to Algorithms*

![front cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Clrs3.jpeg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/), and [Clifford Stein](http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/) has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities and is commonly cited as a reference for algorithms in published papers. Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation "CLRS" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, "CLR" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).

## Top 7. *Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment*

![front cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iD5NiJZNL._SX402_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programming_in_the_Unix_Environment) by [W. Richard Stevens](http://www.kohala.com/start/) describes the application programming interface of the UNIX family of operating systems.

Stevens died in 1999 leaving a second edition incomplete. With the increasing popularity and technical diversification of UNIX derivatives, and largely compatible systems like the Linux environment, the code and coverage of Stevens' original became increasingly outdated. Working with Stevens' unfinished notes, Stephen A. Rago completed a second edition which Addison-Wesley published in 2005. This added support for FreeBSD, Linux, Sun's Solaris, and Apple's Darwin, and added coverage of multithreaded programming with POSIX Threads. The second edition features a foreword by Dennis Ritchie and a Unix-themed Dilbert strip by Scott Adams.

The 3rd edition was published in 2013.

## Top 8. *C++ Primer*

![front cover](https://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=9780321714114&type=f){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*C++ Primer*](https://www.informit.com/store/c-plus-plus-primer-9780321714114) by [Stanley B. Lippman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_B._Lippman), Jos√©e Lajoie and [Barbara E. Moo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_E._Moo) is a proven tutorial for those new to C++, an authoritative discussion of core C++ concepts and techniques, and a valuable resource for experienced programmers.

## Top 9. *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*

![front cover](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/book-cover-two.jpg){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by [Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi) and [Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau) is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently.

This book is and will always be free!

## Top 10. *Code Complete*

![front cover](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/cover/0735619670/250w/){: .align-right width="20%" }

[*Code Complete*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete) by [Steve McConnell](https://stevemcconnell.com/) encourages developers to continue past code-and-fix programming and the big design upfront and waterfall models. It is also a compendium of software construction techniques, which include techniques from naming variables to deciding when to write a subroutine.
