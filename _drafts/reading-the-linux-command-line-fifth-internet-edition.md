William E. Shotts, Jr. had built a [website](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php) to teach the Linux command line. The book [*The Linux Command Line*](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) covers the same material as the website but in much greater detail. It is also completely free available online.

For the author, learning and using Linux means to take back control of computers from a few giant corporations. It means freedom.

> Freedom is the power to decide what your computer does, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

## Notes on Each Chapter

### Part 1 – Learning the Shell

#### 1 – What Is the Shell?

The *shell* is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) created by [Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)) is the default shell of Linux. The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact that `bash` is an enhanced replacement for `sh`, the original UNIX shell program written by [Steve Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne).

We normally use a GUI program called *terminal* to interact with shell.
