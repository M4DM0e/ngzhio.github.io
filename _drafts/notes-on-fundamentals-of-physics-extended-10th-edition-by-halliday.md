[*Fundamentals of Physics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Physics) is a calculus-based physics textbook by [David Halliday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Halliday_(physicist)), [Robert Resnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Resnick), and [Jearl Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jearl_Walker). The first edition of the book to bear the title *Fundamentals of Physics*, first published in 1970, was revised from the original text by Farrell Edwards and John J. Merrill. The edition I read is the 10th which was published in 2013.

## Chapter 1. Measurement

### 1-1 Measuring Things, Including Lengths

#### The International System of Units

> In 1971, the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures picked seven quantities as base quantities, thereby forming the basis of the International System of Units, abbreviated SI from its French name and popularly known as the *metric system*.

These seven quantities are:

| Symbol | Name     | Quantity                  |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| s      | second   | time                      |
| m      | metre    | length                    |
| kg     | kilogram | mass                      |
| A      | ampere   | electric current          |
| K      | kelvin   | thermodynamic temperature |
| mol    | mole     | amount of substance       |
| cd     | candela  | luminous intensity        |

#### Length

The definition of the length unit [*meter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre) has been improved several times. Its current definition was given in 1983:

> The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of \\\(\frac{1}{299 792 458}\\\) of a second.

So the definition of meter depends on the definition of the second.

### 1-2 Time

The 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1967 adopted a standard second based on the cesium clock:

> One second is the time taken by 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the light (of a specified wavelength) emitted by a cesium-133 atom.
