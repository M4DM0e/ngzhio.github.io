## Part I. Getting Started

### Chapter 1. A Python Q&A Session

#### Why Do People Use Python?

- Software quality
  - Readability
  - Coherence
  - OOP
  - Functional programming
- Developer productivity
  - Interpreted
  - Dynamically typed
- Program portability
- Support libraries
- Component integration
- Enjoyment

#### OK, but Whatâ€™s the Downside?

Python's *execution speed* may not always be as fast as that of fully compiled and lower-level languages such as C and C++. The standard implementation of Python ([CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)) compiles source code to an intermediate format known as *byte code* and then interpret the byte code. The [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) system can achieve a 10X to 100X speedup on some code by compiling further as the program runs.

### Chapter 2. How Python Runs Programs

#### Program Execution
