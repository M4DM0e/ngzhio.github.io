Here are some notes I took while I was reading [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, 2nd Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (1996) by [Harold Abelson](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/hal.html) and [Gerald Jay Sussman](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/gjs.html) with Julie Sussman.
