## 1. Atoms in Motion

### 1–2 Matter is made of atoms

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the *atomic hypothesis* (or the atomic *fact*, or whatever you wish to call it) that *all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another*.

> The atoms are 1 or \\\(2\times10^{−8}\\\) cm in radius. Now \\\(10^{−8}\\\) cm is called an *angstrom* (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.

## 4. Conservation of Energy
