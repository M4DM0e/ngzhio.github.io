Here are some notes I took on *[The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)*, Volume I. These lectures were from courses taught by [Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) in 1961-62 to the freshman and sophomore classes at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).

## Feynman’s Preface

> The whole group of 180 students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and then they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory session once a week.

Great happiness!

## 1. Atoms in Motion

### 1–2 Matter is made of atoms

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the *atomic hypothesis* (or the atomic *fact*, or whatever you wish to call it) that *all things are made of atoms -- little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another*. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an *enormous* amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.

Atoms' size:

> The atoms are 1 or \\\(2×10^{−8}\\\) cm in radius. Now \\\(10^{−8}\\\) cm is called an *angstrom* (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.

## 2. Basic Physics
