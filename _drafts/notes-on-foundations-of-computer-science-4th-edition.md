## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Turing Model

The Turing model is a programmable data processor, which was first described in [Turing's 1936 paper](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf).

### 1.2 Von Neumann Model

Around 1944â€“1945, [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) proposed that, since program and data are logically the same, programs should also be stored in the memory of a computer.

## Chapter 3. Data Storage
