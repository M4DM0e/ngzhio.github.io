[*Foundations of Computer Science*, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1473751047/) by Behrouz Forouzan was published in 2018.

## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Turing Model

On the Turing model, a computer is a programmable data processor.

### 1.2 Von Neumann Model

Computers built on the Turing model only store data in their memory. Around 1944-1945, John von Neumann proposed that, since program and data are logically the same, programs should also be stored in the memory of a computer.

On the von Neumann model, a computer is composed of 4 parts: memory, arithmetic logic unit, control unit, and input/output. Besides, this model requires that the execution of instructions should be sequential.

### 1.3 Computer Components

Hardware + software + data.

## Chapter 2. Number Systems
