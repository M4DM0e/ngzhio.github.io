Here are some notes I took while I was reading [*How to Read a Book*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book), [1972 Revised Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671212095) by [Mortimer J. Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler) and [Charles Van Doren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Van_Doren).

This book was first published in 1940, and the subtitle is *The Art of Getting a Liberal Education*; in the 1967 edition, the subtitle became *A Guide to Reading the Great Books*; in the 1972 edition, the subtitle updated again to *The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading*.

## Part I. The Dimensions of Reading

### Chapter 1. The Activity and Art of Reading

The more active the reading the better. How to be more active? Note-taking while reading, as I do now.

### Chapter 2. The Levels of Reading

1. *Elementary Reading*: To recognize the individual words.
2. *Inspectional Reading*: To get the most out of a book within a relatively short time.
3. *Analytical Reading*: To ask many, and organized, ques­tions of what he is reading.
4. *Syn­topical Reading*: To read many books, and to place them in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve.

### Chapter 3. The First Level of Reading: Elementary Reading
