[*What Is Mathematics?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Mathematics%3F) by [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant) and [Herbert Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Robbins) was first published in 1941. A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)).

## Chapter 1. The Natural Numbers

> We shall therefore accept the natural numbers as given, together with the two fundamental operations, addition and multiplication, by which they may be combined.

### &sect;1. Calculation with Integers

#### 1. Laws of Arithmetic

Additions and multiplications of natural numbers obey these laws:

1. The commutative law of additions: \\\(a + b = b + a\\\)
2. The commutative law of multiplications: \\\(ab = ba\\\)
3. The associative law of additions: \\\(a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c\\\)
4. The associative law of multiplications: \\\(a(bc) = (ab)c\\\)
5. The distributive law: \\\(a(b +c) = ab + ac\\\)
