*[What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Mathematics%3F)* is a mathematics book written by [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant) and [Herbert Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Robbins), and was first published in 1941. A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)).

## Chapter 1. The Natural Numbers

This chapter introduces some basic properties of the natural numbers, including arithmetics and the mathematical induction. Not very exciting for me.

## Supplement to Chapter 1. The Theory of Numbers

### &sect; 1. The Prime Numbers

#### 1. Fundamental Facts

Theorem: There are infinite many primes.

Euclid's proof: Suppose there are finite primes, then number them from 1 to n:

\\\[
p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n
\\\]

Now consider

\\\[A = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1\\\]

Obviously, \\\(A\\\) divides by \\\(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\\\) always leaves a remainder 1. So \\\(A\\\) is either a prime larger than \\\(p_n\\\) or a composite number which has a divisor larger than \\\(p_n\\\). This is contradictary to the assumption. \\\(\blacksquare\\\)

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic: *Every integer N greater than 1 can be factored into a product of primes in only one way*.

The book proved this theorem with a logic that is slightly more complicated, but the theorem is obvious: as long as the integer is continuously divided by primes from small to large, we will get a unique prime factorization. Of course, this cannot be regarded as a proof.
