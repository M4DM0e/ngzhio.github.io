[*What Is Mathematics?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Mathematics%3F) by [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant) and [Herbert Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Robbins) is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public. It was first published in 1941; A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)).

## Supplement to Chapter I: The Theory of Numbers

### &sect;1. The Prime Numbers

#### 1. Fundamental Facts

Euclid's proof of the infinitude of the class of primes: Suppose the numbers of primes is finite, then we can list them as \\\(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\\\). Then we form an integer \\\(A = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1\\\). Obviously, each prime in \\\(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\\\) divides \\\(A\\\) with a remainder 1, so either \\\(A\\\) is a prime larger than \\\(p_n\\\), or there is a prime factor of \\\(A\\\) larger than \\\(A\\\). \\\(\blacksquare\\\)

**Fundamental theorem of arithmetic**: *Every integer greater than 1 can be factored into a product of primes in only one way*.

#### 2. The Distribution of the Primes
