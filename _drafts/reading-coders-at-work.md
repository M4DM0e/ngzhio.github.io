[*Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming*](http://www.codersatwork.com/) (2009) by [Peter Seibel](https://twitter.com/peterseibel) is a book containing a series of Q&A interviews with 15 highly accomplished programmers. This form of the book followed in the tradition established when the literary journal [*The Paris Review*](https://www.theparisreview.org/) sent two professors to interview the novelist [E. M. Forster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._M._Forster), the first in  later collected in the book [*Writers at Work*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0140045406).

Peter Seibel asked these folks about programming, and got varied opinions: Jamie Zawinski and Dan Ingalls emphasized the importance of getting code up and running right away while Joshua Bloch emphasized the design of APIs. Donald Knuth wrote a complete version of TeX **in pencil** before he started typing in any code! Fran Allen and Bernie Cosell lay much of the blame for the decline in interest in computer science in recent decades at the feet of C. Ken Thompson argued that security problems are caused by programmers.

However, they also had some common opinions: Writing *readable code* is very important; The hardest bugs to track down are in *concurrent code*; Programming is not a solved problem; Ubiquitous *multi-core CPUs* are going to force some serious changes in the way software is written; Most are still looking for a better way to write software, whether by finding ways to automatically analyze code, coming up with better ways for programmers to work together, or finding (or designing) better programming languages.

## Chapter 1. Jamie Zawinski

> Lisp hacker, early Netscape developer, and nightclub owner [Jamie Zawinski](https://www.jwz.org/blog/), a.k.a. jwz, is a member of the select group of hackers who are as well known by their three-letter initials as by their full names.

## Chapter 2. Brad Fitzpatrick

> [Brad Fitzpatrick](https://bradfitz.com/) is the youngest person I interviewed and the only one who has never lived in a world without the Internet or personal computers. Born in 1980, he got an early start as a programmer, learning to program at age five on a home-built Apple II clone. By his teenage years the Internet revolution was in full swing and he was deep into it, building his first commercial web site while still in high school and starting work on the popular community site [LiveJournal](https://www.livejournal.com/) the summer before he went to college.

## Chapter 3. Douglas Crockford

> A senior JavaScript Architect at Yahoo!, [Douglas Crockford](https://www.crockford.com/) has been a programmer since the early â€™70s when he took a Fortran course in college after being unable to get studio time for his major in television broadcasting. Over the course of his career, he has combined computers with media in various ways at places like Atari, Lucasfilm, Electric Communities, and now Yahoo!
