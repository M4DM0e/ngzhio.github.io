3. Transport Layer
4. Network Layer: Data Plane
5. Network Layer: Control Plane
6. The Link Layer and LANs

The first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networks and the Internet. They are two different ideas -- the Internet is a network of computer networks.

Chapters 2 to 6 are the core part of this book and organized around the top four layers of the five-layer Internet protocol.
