[*The Linux Command Line*](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) is a book by [William Shotts](https://twitter.com/william_shotts). He had built a website [LinuxCommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php) to teach the Linux command line. This book covers the same material as LinuxCommand.org but in much greater detail, and it's available online.

## Introduction

> ... A few giant corporations have been imposing their control over most of the world's computers and deciding what you can and cannot do with them. Fortunately, people from all over the world are doing something about it. They are fighting to maintain control of their computers by writing their own software. They are building Linux.
>
> Many people speak of “freedom” with regard to Linux, but I don't think most people know what this freedom really means. Freedom is the power to decide what your computer does, and the only way to have this freedom is to know what your computer is doing. Freedom is a computer that is without secrets, one where everything can be known if you care enough to find out.

Not everyone is smart enough to completely take control of his/her computer.

## Part 1 – Learning the Shell

### 1 – What Is the Shell?

> The *shell* is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out.

`sh` is the original Unix shell program written by [Steve Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne), and [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is an enhanced replacement for `sh`. The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”. Almost all Linux distributions supply `bash`.

#### Terminal Emulators

> When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need another program called a *terminal emulator* to interact with the shell.

#### Try Some Simple Commands
