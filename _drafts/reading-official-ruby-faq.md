[*Official Ruby FAQ*](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/faq/) contains Frequently Asked Questions about Ruby with answers. It is based on [*The Ruby Language FAQ*](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/FAQ/FAQ.html) originally compiled by [Shugo Maeda](https://twitter.com/shugomaeda) and translated into English by Kentaro Goto. I think it's a good starting point to learn Ruby.
