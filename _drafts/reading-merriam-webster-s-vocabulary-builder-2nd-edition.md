[*Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder*, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0877798559) was published in 2010. It is designed to achieve two goals: (1) to add a large number of words to the permanent working vocabulary of readers, and (2) to teach the most useful of the classical word-building roots to help readers continue expanding the vocabulary in the future.

To achieve these goals, this book employs an original approach that takes into account how people learn and remember: Put words into some meaningful context, show they are useful and worth remembering, and properly explain them.

## Notes on Each Unit

### Unit 1

**BENE** is Latin for “well.” A *benefit* is a good result or effect. Something *beneficial* produces good results or effects.

- **benediction**

    A prayer that asks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.

    "Benediction" is formed by *"bene"* and another Latin root *"dictio"* (means "speaking"). So the word's meaning becomes something like "well-wishing."

- **benefactor**

    Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money.

- **beneficiary**

    A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.

- **benevolence**

    Kindness, generosity.
