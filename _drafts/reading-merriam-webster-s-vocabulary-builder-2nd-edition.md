[*Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder*, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0877798559) was published in 2010. It is designed to achieve two goals: (1) to add a large number of words to the permanent working vocabulary of readers, and (2) to teach the most useful of the classical word-building roots to help readers continue expanding the vocabulary in the future.

To achieve these goals, this book employs an original approach that takes into account how people learn and remember: Put words into some meaningful context, show they are useful and worth remembering, and properly explain them.

## Notes on Each Unit

### Unit 1

**BENE** is Latin for “well.” A *benefit* is a good result or effect. Something *beneficial* produces good results or effects.

- **benediction**: A prayer that asks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.

    "Benediction" is formed by *"bene"* and another Latin root *"dictio"* (means "speaking"). So the word's meaning becomes something like "well-wishing."

- **benefactor**: Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money.

- **beneficiary**: A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.

- **benevolence**: Kindness, generosity.

**AM** comes from the Latin *amare*, “to love.” The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and Amor. Amiable means “friendly or good-natured,” and amigo is Spanish for “friend.”

- **amicable**: Friendly, peaceful.

    "Amicable" often describes relations between two groups, or especially two nations.

- **enamored**: Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.

    Examples:

  - Computer hackers are always *enamored* of their new programs and games.
  - Millions of readers have found themselves *enamored* with Jane Austen's novels.

    Both "of" and "with" are commonly used after "enamored".

- **amorous**: Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love.

    A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But the word is often used a bit sarcastically.

- **paramour**: A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom.

    "Paramour" came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't use the word. Since "par amour" meant “through love,” it implies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony. So today it tends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.
