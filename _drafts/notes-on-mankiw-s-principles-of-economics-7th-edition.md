## Part I. Introduction

### Chapter 1. Ten Principles of Economics

> **Economics** is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

#### 1-1 How People Make Decisions

##### 1-1a Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs

"People face trade-offs" means that to get something that we like, we usually have to give up something else that we also like.

One of the trade-offs a society faces is between *efficiency* and *equality*.

> **Efficiency** means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources. **Equality** means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among societyâ€™s members.

Improve equality, reduce efficiency:

> When the government redistributes income from the rich to the poor, it reduces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and produce fewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

However, the reward of some riches is not come from working hard, it may come from a monopolistic advantage.

##### 1-1b Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It
