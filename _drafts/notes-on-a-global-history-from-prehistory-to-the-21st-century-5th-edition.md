Here are some notes I took on [*A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century*, 5th Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4188793-a-global-history) (1990) by [L. S. Stavrianos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Stavrianos).

## Part II. Classical Civilizations of Eurasia, to A.D. 500

### Chapter 3. First Eurasian Civilizations, 3500-1000 B.C.

#### I. How Ancient Civilizations Began

*Civilizations* include such characteristics as *urban centers*, *institutionalized political authority in the form of the state*, *tribute or taxation*, *writing*, *social stratification into classes or hierarchies*, *monumental architecture*, and *specialized arts* and *sciences*.

The first civilizations emerged in the Middle East, above [Tigris and Euphrates rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris%E2%80%93Euphrates_river_system).
