[*A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0139238972) by [Leften Stavros Stavrianos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Stavrianos) was first published in 1970. The last (7th) edition was published in 1998. But I only found an e-doc of the 5th edition online.

The author said that this book is distinctive in three ways:

1. *It connects the past to the present.* It means the past should be analyzed in a manner that is meaningful for the present, and that the relationship between past and present should be noted and emphasized.
2. *It connects the present to the future.* Historians cannot predict the future exactly, but different sciences provide different predictability. History can show what combination of conditions and policies have resulted in the past in assassinations and revolutions and wars. If we understand such past patterns, then we have some guide to the present and the future.

   However, at this level, history still cannot be called science. Scientific inferences require repeatable experiments to verify, but the conditions of historical events or evolutions cannot be reset, so we have no way to verify the predictions learned from past patterns. Therefore, I think, this function of history is more like philosophy.

3. *It is a world history.*
