[*A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0139238972) by [Leften Stavros Stavrianos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Stavrianos) was first published in 1970. The latest version is the 7th edition which was published in 1998, but the version I read is the 5th edition, which was published in 1991.

The author said that this book is distinctive in three ways:

1. It connects the past to the present. It means that the past should be analyzed in a manner that is meaningful for the present and that the relationship between past and present should be noted and emphasized.
2. It connects the present to the future.
3. It is world history.

In the author's opinion, world history is not a sum of the history of each country or civilization, rather, it emphasizes on movements of worldwide influence.

Even though the author emphasizes that this book describes the spread and progress of civilizations around the world, most of them still stand from the perspective of Western civilization. However, this is indeed unavoidable because, as of today, Western civilization has already completed the "reform" of other civilizations in the world. Not to mention that the author is a Westerner, even if a Chinese is to write the history of the world, I am afraid that the center of gravity will have to lean towards the West.

## Part I. Before Civilization

### Chapter 1. Humans as Food Gatherers

#### From Hominids to Humans

> Earth took form about 5 billion years ago, and the first life appeared on it about 4 billion years ago in the form of single-celled creatures.

By using [radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating) on not only the rocks on Earth but also some rocks from the system that surrounds it, scientists have been able to place Earth's age at approximately [4.54 billion years](https://www.space.com/24854-how-old-is-earth.html).

[The earliest direct evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms) of life on Earth are microfossils of microorganisms permineralized in 3.465-billion-year-old Australian [Apex chert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_chert) rocks.

> The human species is the product of [*natural selection*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection) from a succession of humanlike ancestors, or hominids, some of which were capable of using simple stone tools and weapons. The earliest of these hominids was [Australopithecus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus), believed to have appeared first in the [*savannas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna) of eastern and southern Africa over 4 million years ago.

> The evolutionary process culminating in humankind was finally completed about 40,000 years ago with the appearance of [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens), or "thinking human," although the date perhaps should be pushed back to 100,000 years ago in light of recent excavations in Israel.

As of 2017, the oldest known skeleton of an anatomically modern Homo sapiens is the [Omo-Kibish I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248416302706), which dates to about 196,000 years ago.
