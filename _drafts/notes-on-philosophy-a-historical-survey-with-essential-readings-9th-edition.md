*[Philosophy: A Historical Survey with Essential Readings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/007811909X)* was originally published in 1966 by Samuel Enoch Stumpf. The version I read was the 9th edition published in 2014. The second author is [James Fieser](http://utm.edu/staff/jfieser/) (I don't know when he joined the writing of this book), who is the founder and the editor-in-chief of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy website ([iep.utm.edu](https://www.iep.utm.edu/)).

## Part 1. Ancient Greek Philosophy

### Chapter 1. Socrates’s Predecessors

#### What Is Permanent in Existence?

##### Thales

Thales earned the title of “First Philosopher” of Western civilization because he firstly concerned these problems: What is everything made of, or what kind of “stuff” goes into the composition of things? His answer was *water*.

##### Anaximander

Anaximander agreed witth Thales that there is some single basic stuff out of which everything comes. Unlike Thales, however, Anaximander said that this basic stuff is neither water nor any other specific element. It is an *indefinite* or *boundless* realm. It's called *[Apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron)* (/əˈpaɪrɒn/; ἄπειρον).

> His explanation is this: The indeterminate boundless is the unoriginated and indestructible primary substance of things, yet it also has eternal motion. As a consequence of this motion, the various specific elements came into being as they “separated off” from the original substance. Thus, “there was an eternal motion in which the heavens came to be.” First *warm* and *cold* were separated off, and from these two came *moist*; then from these came *earth* and *air*.

##### Anaximenes
