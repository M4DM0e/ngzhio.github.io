*[Philosophy: A Historical Survey with Essential Readings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/007811909X)* was originally published in 1966 by Samuel Enoch Stumpf. The version I read was the 9th edition published in 2014. The second author is [James Fieser](http://utm.edu/staff/jfieser/) (I don't know when he joined the writing of this book), who is the founder and the editor-in-chief of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy website ([iep.utm.edu](https://www.iep.utm.edu/)).
