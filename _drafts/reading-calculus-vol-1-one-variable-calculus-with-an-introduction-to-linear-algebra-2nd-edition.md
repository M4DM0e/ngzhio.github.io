Here are some notes I took while I was reading [*Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra*, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471000051) (1967) by [Tom M. Apostol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Apostol).

These two questions look like unrelated at first sight, but calculus will tell us they are related.

#### The method of exhaustion for the area of a parabolic segment
