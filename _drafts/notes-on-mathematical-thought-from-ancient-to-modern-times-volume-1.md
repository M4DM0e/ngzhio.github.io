*Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times* by [Morris Kline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Kline) is a three-volume book on the history of mathematics. The first edition was published in 1972.

## Chapter 1. Mathematics in Mesopotamia

### 1. Where Did Mathematics Begin?

The author traced the beginning of the history of mathematics back to Babylon and Egypt around 3000 B.C. Then we have to take a look at what great leaps the Babylonians and Egyptians made in mathematics at that time.

### 2. Political History in Mesopotamia

What "Babylonian" means:

> The term "Babylonian" covers a series of peoples, who concurrently or successively occupied the area around and between the [Tigris](https://goo.gl/maps/sJoAw4YW4uLA7G226) and [Euphrates](https://goo.gl/maps/XhJpQRDBFDFmnjxF6) rivers, a region known as [Mesopotamia](https://goo.gl/maps/dTP6S3bwLv2fvQPf9) and now part of modern Iraq. These peoples lived in independent cities such as Babylon, Ur, Nippur, Susa, Assur, Uruk, Lagash, Kish, and others.

### 3. The Number Symbols

> Our main information about the civilization and mathematics of Babylonia, ancient and more recent, comes from texts in the form of clay tablets. These tablets were inscribed when the clay was still soft and then baked. Hence those that survived destruction are well preserved.

We can imagine that there may be other civilizations in the world that developed mathematics before Babylon, but the writing materials are too fragile to be known to future generations.
