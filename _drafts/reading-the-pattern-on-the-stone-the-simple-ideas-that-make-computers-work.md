[William Daniel Hillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis) (born September 25, 1956) is an American inventor, entrepreneur, and scientist, who pioneered parallel computers and their use in artificial intelligence. In 1998, he wrote a book [*The Pattern On The Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/046502596X) to explain concepts from computer science by using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves from *Boolean algebra* through topics such as *finite-state machines*, *programming languages*, *compilers and interpreters*, *information theory*, *parallel computing*, *cryptography*, *algorithms*, *heuristics*, *Turing machines*, *uncomutable functions*, and evolving technologies such as *quantum computing*, *neural networks*, *machine learning*, and *self-organizing systems*.

The author compares the computer to a stone (it is clever, after all, computer chips are made of silicon), and compares the program to a pattern of spells etched on the stone -- that's the source of the strange title of this book.

Computers are complex but also simple. Here are some principles that make computers easy to understand:

1. *Computers are built up in a hierarchy of parts, with each part repeated many times over*.

   So for understading a computer, we can analyze it into a hierarchy of parts, then try to understand each part first.

2. *The interactions among these parts are simple, well-defined, and usually one-directional*.

   So that the actions of the computer can be sorted neatly into causes and effects.

3. *Computers are not dependent so much on technology as on ideas*.

   This book is about ideas but not the technology.

## Notes on Each Chapter

### Chapter 1. Nuts and Bolts

The first book the author ever read on the subject of computation was [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)'s [*An Investigation of the Laws of Thought*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laws_of_Thought) -- What a high start point! In the book, Boole reduced the logic of human thoughts into mathematical operations that later called the *Boolean algebra*. In 1940, [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) published his master's thesis [*A Symbolic Analysis of Relay Switching Circuits*](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/greatworks/shannon38.pdf). In the article, he showed that it was possible to build electrical circuits equivalent to expressions in Boolean algebra. In Shannonâ€™s circuits, switches that were open or closed corresponded to logical variables of Boolean algebra that were true or false. Shannon demonstrated a way of converting any expression in Boolean algebra into an arrangement of switches. The circuit would establish a connection if the statement was true and break the connection if it was false. This reveals that **the circuit can perform human logical inferences**.
