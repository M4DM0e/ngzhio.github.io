*[Philosophy: A Historical Survey with Essential Readings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/007811909X)* was originally published in 1966 by Samuel Enoch Stumpf. The version I read was the 9th edition published in 2014. The second author is [James Fieser](http://utm.edu/staff/jfieser/) (I don't know when he joined the writing of this book), who is the founder and the editor-in-chief of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy website ([iep.utm.edu](https://www.iep.utm.edu/)).

## Part 1. Ancient Greek Philosophy

### Chapter 1. Socrates’s Predecessors

The title of this chapter indicates that the coordinate origin of ancient Greek philosophy was Socrates.

Socrates’s Predecessors include:

- [Thales](#thales)
- [Anaximander](#anaximander)
- [Anaximenes](#anaximenes)
- [Pythagoras](#pythagoras)
- [Heraclitus](#heraclitus)
- [Parmenides](#parmenides)
- [Zeno](#zeno)

- [Anaxagoras](#anaxagoras)

#### Thales

Thales of [Miletus](https://goo.gl/maps/t77komWkwUXhRn6Q7), who earned the title of "First Philosopher", left no writings, we can know him only from later writers who recorded memorable incidents in his career.

Thales’s novel inquiry concerns the nature of things. What is everything made of, or what kind of “stuff” goes into the composition of things? His answer was *water*. This was wrong from contemporary views, but his question was more important than his answer.

#### Anaximander

Anaximander was a student of Thales. He agreed with his teacher that there is some single basic stuff out of which everything comes. Unlike Thales, however, Anaximander said that this basic stuff is neither water nor any other specific element. He called this basic stuff as "*Apeiron*", which means *indefinite* or *boundless*.

#### Anaximenes

#### Pythagoras

#### Parmenides

#### Zeno
