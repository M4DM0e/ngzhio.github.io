## Unit 1

### BENE

> **BENE** is Latin for “well.” A *benefit* is a good result or effect. Something *beneficial* produces good results or effects.

- **benediction** A prayer that asks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.

    > In *benediction*, the *bene* root is joined by another Latin root, *dictio*, “speaking” (see DICT), so the word's meaning becomes something like “well-wishing.”

- **benefactor** Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money. *Benefaction* means the given money by the benefactor.

- **beneficiary** A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.

- **benevolence** Kindness, generosity.

### AM

> **AM** comes from the Latin *amare*, “to love.” The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and *Amor*. *Amiable* means “friendly or good-natured,” and *amigo* is Spanish for “friend.”

- **amicable** Friendly, peaceful.
- **enamored** Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.

  Examples:

  > - Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games.
  > - Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's novels.

  Both "of" and "with" are commonly used after "enamored".

- **amorous** Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love.

  A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing.

- **paramour** A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom.

  "Paramour" came to English from French (a language based on Latin) "par amour", which meant "through love", so it implies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony.

### BELL
