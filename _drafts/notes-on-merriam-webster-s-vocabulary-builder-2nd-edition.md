## Unit 1

### BENE

> **BENE** is Latin for “well.” A *benefit* is a good result or effect. Something *beneficial* produces good results or effects.

- **benediction** A prayer that asks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.

    > In *benediction*, the *bene* root is joined by another Latin root, *dictio*, “speaking” (see DICT), so the word's meaning becomes something like “well-wishing.”

- **benefactor** Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money. *Benefaction* means the given money by the benefactor.

- **beneficiary** A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.

- **benevolence** Kindness, generosity.

### AM
