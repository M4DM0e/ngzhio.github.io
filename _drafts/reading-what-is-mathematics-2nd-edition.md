*What Is Mathematics?* is a mathematics book written by [Richard Courant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant) and [Herbert Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Robbins), first published in 1941. It is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public. A [second edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195105192) was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [Ian Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(mathematician)).

## Notes on Each Chapter

### Chapter I. The Natural Numbers

Arithmetic of integers and the mathematical induction.

### Supplement to Chapter I. The Theory of Numbers

#### Prime Numbers

##### Fundamental

Euclid's method to prove the infinitude of prime numbers: First, suppose there would be only a finite numbers of primes \\\(p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_n\\\), then we form a number

\\\[
A = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1
\\\]

Obviously, each of \\\(p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_n\\\) divides \\\(A\\\) with a remainder 1, so that either \\\(A\\\) is a prime, or it contains a prime which is larger than \\\(p_n\\\). \\\(\blacksquare\\\)

**Fundamental theorem of arithmetic**: Every integer greater than 1 can be factored into a product of primes in only one way.

##### The Distribution of Primes
