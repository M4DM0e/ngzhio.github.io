## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Turing Model

The idea of a universal computational device was first described by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) in [1936](http://140.177.205.52/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf). He proposed that all computation could be performed by a special kind of a machine, now called a *Turing machine*. This machine could be described as a *programmable data processor*.
