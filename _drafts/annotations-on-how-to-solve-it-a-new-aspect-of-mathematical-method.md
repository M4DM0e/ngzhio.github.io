[*How to Solve It*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) by [G. Polya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya) was first published in 1945. The version I read was published in 2004 by Princeton University Press. That version contains a new foreword by [John H. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

## Foreword by John H. Conway

> [A. H. Schoenfeld](https://gse.berkeley.edu/alan-h-schoenfeld) correctly described its importance in his 1987 article [“Polya, Problem Solving, and Education”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0025570X.1987.11977325?journalCode=umma20) in *Mathematics Magazine*: “For mathematics education and the world of problem solving it marked a line of demarcation between two eras, problem solving before and after Polya.”

> Polya had met many more students than I had, and had obviously thought very hard about how to best help all of them learn mathematics. Perhaps his most important point is that **learning must be active**.

## Part I. In the Classroom

### Purpose

1. Helping the student.

    > The teacher should help, but not too much and not too little, so that the student shall have a *reasonable share of the work*.
